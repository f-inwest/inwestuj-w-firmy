    accredited investor, you can bid for a piece of the action.
lang_what_we_do_1=The world of startup founding and investment is traditionally opaque and\
    inaccessable.  It is difficult and time consuming for an entpreneur to go\
    around by hand to countless angels and venture funds, hoping for that one shot\
    in a hundred to get a callback, time that could be spent getting new customers\
    and growing the business.  Likewise those wanting to invest in startups will\
    find the door closed to all but those with very large wallets and pre-existing\
    personal connections.
lang_what_we_do_2=Inwestuj w Firmy changes all that.  Any entrepreneur worldwide can place their\
    startup and businessplan online and get instant feedback, commentary, and bids\
    from interested investors.  Investors liktewise can view the gamut of startup\
    offerings around the world, all in one place, and make a bid for investment in\
    the company.  Those more of the armchair-quarterback variety can sit back, ask\
    questions, make comments, and see how the startup progresses.  Inwestuj w Firmy is\
    the brave new world of startup financing.
lang_what_we_do_3=Inwestuj w Firmy is entirely free.  There are no charges to use the service.  There\
    are no fees for listing, investing, or receiving investment.
lang_how_to_post_1=Getting your startup listed on inwestuj-w-firmy is not only fast, but can also\
    help you clarify your own ideas and business plan.  First, you need to gather\
    together the existing materials you have, at a minimum your logo, a short\
    presentation in powerpoint or pdf, and your business plan in word or pdf\
    format.  Most importantly, think about if you want to ask for money and if so,\
    how much, and for what percent of your company, as\
    you&rsquo;ll need to enter this information.  If you&rsquo;re not already a member, then\
    sign in by clicking Sign In on the header link.  After you&rsquo;re registered, click\
    on the Post link on the header to begin the process.  There are several steps\
    in the process, designed not only to get all your information in one coherent\
    structure, but also to get you thinking about how to improve and focus your\
    business.  If you aren&rsquo;t sure about some questions, you can wait and come back\
    later, as your entries are automatically saved.  Finally once you&rsquo;ve finished\
    all the steps, you can review a preview of your startup listing and submit it\
    for our approval.  Then we will review the listing, contact you with any needed\
    changes, and then post it live.  Be aware that once submissions are posted, they\
    cannot be changed; if necessary you must withdraw and resubmit a new listing.
lang_how_to_post_2=Once your listing is live, you will immediately be displayed on the top page\
    and in the relevant search categories.  Members may comment and bid upon your\
    listing which will be reflected in the search rankings.  If you&rsquo;ve chosen to\
    ask for money, you will also be able to receive bids from investors worldwide\
    from then onward.  If you receive a bid, you will be notified in your\
    notifications tab and via email of the investment amount and terms.  You may\
    then either accept, reject, or make a counteroffer.  In the case of a\
    counteroffer, the investor will receive notice of the counter and will then be\
    able to accept, reject, or counter the offer themselves.  This process proceeds\
    until one side either accepts or rejects an offer.  Bids may be received as\
    long as the listing is active.
lang_how_to_post_3=You may accept as many bids as you wish during a funding round.  Once a bid is accepted,\
    inwestuj-w-firmy will then contact both you and the investor to pursue a formal funding agreement.\
    It is recommended that this be done upon the advice of your own legal counsel.  We\
    will then send you an invoice for a fee upon completed bidding as per the terms and\
    conditions.  Happy posting and success in all your ventures!
lang_how_to_bid_1=The first step in bidding on a startup is finding the right startup to bid on.\
    You will find a wide variety of ways to find startups at inwestuj-w-firmy, from\
    the socially ranked top listings page, to the latest listings page, to geographic\
    location searches, as well as keyword searches on the fulltext indexes of\
    all listing information including the business plan.
lang_how_to_bid_2=Professional venture capitalists typically review a hundred or more proposals\
    before investing in one, so it pays to review each listing thoroughly.  We at\
    inwestuj-w-firmy have been on both sides of the fence in the startup community,\
    both as investors and as entrpreneuers.  In that vein we have gathered the most\
    important questions and key information you need to quickly review a startup\
    before deciding if it warrants the time for more extensive investigation.  Each\
    of our listings is required to answer a standard set of investor-oriented questions\
    and post a detailed business plan, so you will have the information you need\
    to quickly analyze the business.
lang_how_to_bid_3=Once you&rsquo;ve found the right startup for your investment portfolio, and made\
    your own independent valuation of the company, you can put in your own bid\
    for a share of the firm.  You will find an asking bid amount for a given\
    equity percentage, along with the implied valuation, on the startup listing\
    page.  When placing a bid, you are not bound by the asking price or percentage,\
    you may freely chose your own bid parameters as well as a private bid note\
    to the entrepreneur.  After placing your bid, the entrepreneur will then receive\
    a notifiaction of the bid and will have a chance to accept, reject, or make\
    a counteroffer.  In the case of a counteroffer, you will receive notice of\
    the counter and will then be able to accept, reject, or counter the offer yourself.\
    This process proceeds until one side either accepts or rejects an offer.
lang_how_to_bid_4=In the case of acceptance, the entrepreneur will be immediately notified of the\
    accepted bid and both of you will be sent an email notice of the completion.\
    You then will be asked to follow up with a formal funding agreement\
    by the advice of legal counsel.  Happy bidding and success in all your investments!
