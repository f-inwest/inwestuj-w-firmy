lang_piece_action_desc=With inwestuj-w-firmy, you&rsquo;re plugged into the pulse of the startup community. \
    Keep up to date on all the latest startups.  Post your own startup as an \
    entrepreneur, getting feedback and exposure to investors worldwide.  As an \
    accredited investor, you can bid for a piece of the action.
lang_what_we_do_1=The world of startup founding and investment is traditionally opaque and \
    inaccessable.  It is difficult and time consuming for an entpreneur to go \
    around by hand to countless angels and venture funds, hoping for that one shot \
    in a hundred to get a callback, time that could be spent getting new customers \
    and growing the business.  Likewise those wanting to invest in startups will \
    find the door closed to all but those with very large wallets and pre-existing \
    personal connections.
lang_what_we_do_2=Inwestuj w Firmy changes all that.  Any entrepreneur worldwide can place their \
    startup and businessplan online and get instant feedback, commentary, and bids \
    from interested investors.  Investors liktewise can view the gamut of startup \
    offerings around the world, all in one place, and make a bid for investment in \
    the company.  Those more of the armchair-quarterback variety can sit back, ask \
    questions, make comments, and see how the startup progresses.  Inwestuj w Firmy is \
    the brave new world of startup financing.
lang_what_we_do_3=Inwestuj w Firmy is entirely free.  There are no charges to use the service.  There \
    are no fees for project, investing, or receiving investment.
lang_how_to_post_1=Getting your startup listed on inwestuj-w-firmy is not only fast, but can also \
    help you clarify your own ideas and business plan.  First, you need to gather \
    together the existing materials you have, at a minimum your logo, a short \
    presentation in powerpoint or pdf, and your business plan in word or pdf \
    format.  Most importantly, think about if you want to ask for money and if so, \
    how much, and for what percent of your company, as \
    you&rsquo;ll need to enter this information.  If you&rsquo;re not already a member, then \
    sign in by clicking Sign In on the header link.  After you&rsquo;re registered, click \
    on the Post link on the header to begin the process.  There are several steps \
    in the process, designed not only to get all your information in one coherent \
    structure, but also to get you thinking about how to improve and focus your \
    business.  If you aren&rsquo;t sure about some questions, you can wait and come back \
    later, as your entries are automatically saved.  Finally once you&rsquo;ve finished \
    all the steps, you can review a preview of your startup project and submit it \
    for our approval.  Then we will review the project, contact you with any needed \
    changes, and then post it live.  Be aware that once submissions are posted, they \
    cannot be changed; if necessary you must withdraw and resubmit a new project.
lang_how_to_post_2=Once your project is live, you will immediately be displayed on the top page \
    and in the relevant search categories.  Members may comment and bid upon your \
    project which will be reflected in the search rankings.  If you&rsquo;ve chosen to \
    ask for money, you will also be able to receive bids from investors worldwide \
    from then onward.  If you receive a bid, you will be notified in your \
    notifications tab and via email of the investment amount and terms.  You may \
    then either accept, reject, or make a counteroffer.  In the case of a \
    counteroffer, the investor will receive notice of the counter and will then be \
    able to accept, reject, or counter the offer themselves.  This process proceeds \
    until one side either accepts or rejects an offer.  Bids may be received as \
    long as the project is active.
lang_how_to_post_3=You may accept as many bids as you wish during a funding round.  Once a bid is accepted, \
    inwestuj-w-firmy will then contact both you and the investor to pursue a formal funding agreement. \
    It is recommended that this be done upon the advice of your own legal counsel.  We \
    will then send you an invoice for a fee upon completed bidding as per the terms and \
    conditions.  Happy posting and success in all your ventures!
lang_how_to_bid_1=The first step in bidding on a startup is finding the right startup to bid on. \
    You will find a wide variety of ways to find startups at inwestuj-w-firmy, from \
    the socially ranked top projects page, to the latest projects page, to geographic \
    location searches, as well as keyword searches on the fulltext indexes of \
    all project information including the business plan.
lang_how_to_bid_2=Professional venture capitalists typically review a hundred or more proposals \
    before investing in one, so it pays to review each project thoroughly.  We at \
    inwestuj-w-firmy have been on both sides of the fence in the startup community, \
    both as investors and as entrpreneuers.  In that vein we have gathered the most \
    important questions and key information you need to quickly review a startup \
    before deciding if it warrants the time for more extensive investigation.  Each \
    of our projects is required to answer a standard set of investor-oriented questions \
    and post a detailed business plan, so you will have the information you need \
    to quickly analyze the business.
lang_how_to_bid_3=Once you&rsquo;ve found the right startup for your investment portfolio, and made \
    your own independent valuation of the company, you can put in your own bid \
    for a share of the firm.  You will find an asking bid amount for a given \
    equity percentage, along with the implied valuation, on the startup project \
    page.  When placing a bid, you are not bound by the asking price or percentage, \
    you may freely chose your own bid parameters as well as a private bid note \
    to the entrepreneur.  After placing your bid, the entrepreneur will then receive \
    a notifiaction of the bid and will have a chance to accept, reject, or make \
    a counteroffer.  In the case of a counteroffer, you will receive notice of \
    the counter and will then be able to accept, reject, or counter the offer yourself. \
    This process proceeds until one side either accepts or rejects an offer.
lang_how_to_bid_4=In the case of acceptance, the entrepreneur will be immediately notified of the \
    accepted bid and both of you will be sent an email notice of the completion. \
    You then will be asked to follow up with a formal funding agreement \
    by the advice of legal counsel.  Happy bidding and success in all your investments!
