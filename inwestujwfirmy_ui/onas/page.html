					The world of startup founding and investment is traditionally opaque and inaccessable. It is difficult and time consuming for an entpreneur to go around by hand to countless angels and venture funds, hoping for that one shot in a hundred to get a callback, time that could be spent getting new customers and growing the business. Likewise those wanting to invest in startups will find the door closed to all but those with very large wallets and pre-existing personal connections.
					</p><p>
					Startupbidder changes all that. Any entrepreneur worldwide can place their startup and businessplan online and get instant feedback, commentary, and bids from interested investors. Investors liktewise can view the gamut of startup offerings around the world, all in one place, and make a bid for investment in the company. Those more of the armchair-quarterback variety can sit back, ask questions, make comments, and see how the startup progresses. Startupbidder is the brave new world of startup financing.
					</p><p>
					Startupbidder is entirely free. There are no charges to use the service. There are no fees for listing, investing, or receiving investment.

					Getting your startup listed on startupbidder is not only fast, but can also help you clarify your own ideas and business plan. First, you need to gather together the existing materials you have, at a minimum your logo, a short presentation in powerpoint or pdf, and your business plan in word or pdf format. Most importantly, think about if you want to ask for money and if so, how much, and for what percent of your company, as you’ll need to enter this information. If you’re not already a member, then sign in by clicking Sign In on the header link. After you’re registered, click on the Post link on the header to begin the process. There are several steps in the process, designed not only to get all your information in one coherent structure, but also to get you thinking about how to improve and focus your business. If you aren’t sure about some questions, you can wait and come back later, as your entries are automatically saved. Finally once you’ve finished all the steps, you can review a preview of your startup listing and submit it for our approval. Then we will review the listing, contact you with any needed changes, and then post it live. Be aware that once submissions are posted, they cannot be changed; if necessary you must withdraw and resubmit a new listing.
					</p><p>
					Once your listing is live, you will immediately be displayed on the top page and in the relevant search categories. Members may comment and bid upon your listing which will be reflected in the search rankings. If you’ve chosen to ask for money, you will also be able to receive bids from investors worldwide from then onward. If you receive a bid, you will be notified in your notifications tab and via email of the investment amount and terms.
