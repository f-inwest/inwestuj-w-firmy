					Application valuation is determined by a mix of current results and future potential. If the app is beyond the concept stage and already released, we look at how much money it cost to  create and how much revenue it’s been achieving so far. We then optionally add to this an analysis into the future potential of the app with sufficient investment and resources.st. That's Startupbidder, getting startups funded.
